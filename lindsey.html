  <h3>Hi everyone! My name is Lindsey Gill and I am a Junior BS/IT major. I am 20 years old and I live in New York. I started learning to code when I was a junior in high school, and I enjoyed it so I applied to Pace as a Computer Science major, then later changed to an IT major. I enjoy playing video games, spending time with friends, and my new puppy! I recently started a new part-time job at Forever 21 and it is going good so far. I look forward to learning new things from this Web Scripting course. Nice to meet you all!</h3>
